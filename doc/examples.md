# Example Usage

A full set of tutorials guiding the user from simple sounds to full pieces is currently planned to be written. Until those are released, you can best learn Pink and Score by looking at the [Music Examples](https://github.com/kunstmusik/music-examples) project on Github.  There you'll find some sample files that show various commented examples of using Pink and Score together.
