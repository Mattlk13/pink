# Pink

A library for music systems development, written in Clojure.

## Introduction

This library provides the basis for developing music systems.  It is also designed so to scale to user needs, whether they are exploring and designing low-level signal processing algorithms, developing pre-written compositions, or creating interactive real-time systems. It offers a slim core engine designed to be highly customizable.   

Features include:

* 64-bit signal processing chain
* Functional Audio Signal Graph: Build up Audio Graphs using functional approach
* Clear Synchronization of time-aware functions with Control Functions
* Higher-order Events: Functions and events can be used as arguments to events 
* Use Clojure to extend the system: single language for all extension points to the system

For more information, please see the [Documentation](doc/intro.md).
