# Pink

A music system written in Clojure.

## Premise for Design

The following are principles of design for this library:

1. The functions of the library shall be designed for maximal reuse
2. A function that is useful for one area of the system might very well be useful on another level
3. The user shall be provided with a simple API that will seek to cover general use cases for the library. This top-level API shall be designed as an encoding of a best practice for a given use case, but will not presume to be a generalized solution for all use cases.
4. The user shall be able to create alternate systems using the lower-level, full API of functions. The assumption is that the user is working towards a use case that is not accounted for by the top-level API. It is hoped then that the use case be published and the user's own system design be submitted to become part of the top-level API, given that the use case may be one that others will come across.
5. The system should be based on common abstractions (i.e. functions, closures) and seek to introduce as few new abstractions as possible.

## Usage

TBD

## Notes

* To be further discussed
  * Inversion of Control (IOC)
  * Events as delayed function applications
  * Events as higher order functions (i.e. passing in audio-rate functions as arguments)
