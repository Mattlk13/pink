# Pink

A library for music systems development, written in Clojure.

## Introduction

This library provides the basis for developing music systems.  It is also designed so to scale to user needs, whether they are exploring and designing low-level signal processing algorithms, developing pre-written compositions, or creating interactive real-time systems. It offers a slim core engine designed to be highly customizable.   

For more information, please see the [Documentation](doc/intro.md).
